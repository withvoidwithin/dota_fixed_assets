# Dota Fixed Assets
Not all assets in Dota 2, are good for map design. Some textures are terrible, where the pivot point is shifted too much or models are combined in one pile.

I tried to fix some of the models and make them good for use in the creation of maps. These new models do not require new textures, they use old ones that are in the game itself. That's why the pack weighs not so much.

Some models need serious repotologizing and at the moment I don't have enough free time to do it.

# More Assets

I've made this available pack for anyone who wants it. If you need more models fixed, you can contact me and suggest which models you would like to fix. I do it for free, but if you want to support me, come to my [Boosty](https://boosty.to/withvoidwithin) :)
